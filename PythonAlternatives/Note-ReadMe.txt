Note:

This version of Fractal Friday was adapted from the original version to a project I started called Theorama, which is essentially a website/cross-platorm band that aims to express physics and math in a totally non-academic enviroment. 

The project is paused, because I'm working on other stuff but you can check it out on Instagram (@theorama_org)
