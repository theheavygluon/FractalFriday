Note:

This version of Fractal Friday was adapted from the original version to a project I started called Theorama, which is essentially a website/cross-platorm physics content creator that aims to express physics and math in a totally non-academic enviroment. The MATLAB version has several more examples, as it was created before

The project is paused, because I'm working on other stuff but you can check it out on Instagram (@theorama_org)
